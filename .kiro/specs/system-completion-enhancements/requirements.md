# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on completing the Claude Smart Automation System by implementing the missing automation tiers and enhancing branch naming pattern support. Based on the implementation status analysis, the system currently has an 82% conformance rate with the specification, with key gaps in automation tier coverage (50% implemented) and branch naming patterns (33% implemented). This enhancement will bring the system to full specification compliance while maintaining the existing high-quality security and core component implementations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want access to all six automation tiers (Ultimate, Full, Rapid, Smart, Issue Processor, Code Review), so that I can choose the optimal automation level for my project's needs and constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user configures Ultimate Automation THEN the system SHALL execute every minute with processing completion within 1 minute
2. WHEN a user configures Rapid Automation THEN the system SHALL execute every 5 minutes with processing completion within 5 minutes  
3. WHEN a user configures Smart Automation THEN the system SHALL use intelligent scheduling with processing completion within 1 hour
4. WHEN any automation tier is triggered THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing security patterns (17 types) and quality checks (10 stages)
5. WHEN multiple automation tiers are active THEN the system SHALL prevent conflicts and resource contention

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive branch naming pattern support (9+ patterns), so that the system can automatically detect and work with various branching strategies used across different projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes an issue THEN it SHALL support standard patterns: issue-{number}, claude-{number}, feature/issue-{number}, fix/issue-{number}
2. WHEN the system processes an issue THEN it SHALL support specialized patterns: hotfix/issue-{number}, claude/issue-{number}, automation-{number}
3. WHEN the system processes an issue THEN it SHALL support categorized patterns: security/issue-{number}, enhancement/issue-{number}
4. WHEN multiple branch patterns are possible THEN the system SHALL select the most appropriate pattern based on issue type and priority
5. WHEN a custom branch pattern is needed THEN the system SHALL provide configuration options for project-specific patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want intelligent scheduling capabilities (RepairGPT scheduling), so that automation runs are optimized for different time zones and work patterns to maximize efficiency while minimizing resource usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Smart Automation is configured THEN the system SHALL implement timezone-optimized scheduling for weekday evenings and weekend daytime
2. WHEN RepairGPT scheduling is active THEN the system SHALL execute at optimal times: weekdays 14:00, 17:00, 20:00 and weekends 01:00, 05:00, 09:00, 13:00 UTC
3. WHEN intelligent scheduling is enabled THEN the system SHALL adapt execution frequency based on repository activity patterns
4. WHEN resource constraints are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust scheduling to prevent GitHub Actions quota exhaustion
5. WHEN multiple repositories use the system THEN the scheduling SHALL distribute load to prevent API rate limiting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want enhanced monitoring and performance tracking for all automation tiers, so that I can ensure optimal system performance and quickly identify any issues across the complete automation suite.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any automation tier executes THEN the system SHALL log processing time, success rate, and resource usage metrics
2. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL generate alerts and automatically adjust tier selection recommendations
3. WHEN automation tiers are compared THEN the system SHALL provide performance analytics showing efficiency trade-offs between tiers
4. WHEN system health is checked THEN all six automation tiers SHALL report their operational status and last execution results
5. WHEN troubleshooting is needed THEN the system SHALL provide detailed execution logs for each automation tier with error categorization

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless integration between existing and new automation tiers, so that I can upgrade or switch between automation levels without losing functionality or requiring system reconfiguration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching between automation tiers THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing configurations, labels, and quality gates
2. WHEN upgrading from existing tiers to new tiers THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with current workflows
3. WHEN multiple tiers are configured THEN the system SHALL provide clear tier selection guidance based on project requirements
4. WHEN tier conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL automatically resolve conflicts using predefined priority rules
5. WHEN tier migration is needed THEN the system SHALL provide automated migration tools and validation checks
